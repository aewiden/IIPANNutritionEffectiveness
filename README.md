# IIPANNutritionEffectiveness
Takes the measurements of a young cancer patient, such as weight, height, and arm circumference, and predicts their likelihood of survival from cancer with different nutritional treatments applied according to IIPAN data collected.
Displays, using GUI, a BMI index and its class, risk for mortality for childhood cancer (ALL and AML), and a message regarding the quality of the individualâ€™s health. The app requires the user to input information into a scanner that describes a child - weight, height, age, ethnicity, sex, state they live in, and socioeconomic status (high, middle, low). Using this information, the program will calculate BMI, which will then be used to determine risk for mortality. Additionally, if the child is obese, my program will calculate the type of obesity based on BMI, race, and socioeconomic status and recommend supplements based on that information. The output that should be seen is a window displaying BMI with a class description underneath it (normal weight, class I obesity, class II obesity, etc.), an increased risk for mortality underneath it displayed as a percentage, and a list of recommended nutritional treatments underneath the mortality risk.

Made in conjunction with Dr. Elena Ladas' research in integrative medicine at Columbia Univeristy.
